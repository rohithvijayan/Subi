1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
What did you think about the ride?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,909
It was great, and apparently I've never been on live television before, but

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
apparently sometimes I don't watch the news, because I'm a kid, and apparently every time,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
apparently Grandpa just gives me a remote after we watch the Powerball.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,385
Tell me about the ride.

6
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,433
What did you think about the ride?

7
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:28,578
Well, it was great.

8
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:28,819
Why?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Because apparently you're spinning around, and apparently every time you get dizzy,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,229
that's all you do is get dizzy.

11
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,270
Is it fun?

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,791
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,588
And I've never ever been on live television.

14
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,941
I've never ever been on live television.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,081
Are you excited?

16
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,932
Yeah, and apparently I already went down the super slide.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,520
When I went down the slide, I was scared half to death.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,917
I just freak out.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,128
Okay, okay.

20
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,769
What's his name?

21
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,794
Hi, honey.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,041
Hold on, yep, hold on, I'm just going to ask him.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,708
What's his name?

24
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:02,916
Noah.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,731
Noah, what's your last name?

26
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,902
Dick Ritter.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,788
How do you spell his last name?

28
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:09,942
Ritter, R-I-T-T-E-R.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,363
Okay, where are you guys from?

30
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:11,954
Wilkes-Barre.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,509
Wilkes-Barre, all right, buddy.

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,754
Good stuff.

33
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,773
Have fun.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's a boy here looking for you.
