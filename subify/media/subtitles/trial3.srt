00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 So, what's new, Mark? How is your new job going?

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 To be honest, I can't complain. I really love the company that I am working for.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 My co-workers are all really friendly and helpful. They really help me feel welcome.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 It's a really energetic and fun atmosphere. My boss is hilarious. And he's really flexible.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Really? How so?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 He allows me to come in when I want and make my own hours.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I can also leave early if I start early. There is no real dress code either.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I can wear jeans and a T-shirt if I want. I can even wear shorts in the summer.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Wow! It sounds really cool. I can't stand wearing a suit every day.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Which do you prefer? Working late or finishing early?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I prefer finishing early. I really enjoy the morning.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I love getting up early and going for a run.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 There's nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Really? I am opposite. I love sleeping in.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I am most alert in the evenings. I'm a real night owl.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Well, you know what they say. The early bird catches the worm.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 You know, you could be right. Maybe I will try to go to bed a little earlier tonight.
